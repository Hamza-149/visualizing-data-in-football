I embarked on an intriguing data exploration project, analyzing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle with international football match data spanning from 1872 to 2022. Using Python, I prepared and cleaned the data to ensure accurate results.

With a sharp eye for detail, I identified and analyzed interesting patterns and trends within the dataset, providing valuable insights into the world of international football.

To make the data more engaging, I used visualization techniques, creating clear and compelling representations of the trends. The final output painted a vivid picture of the sport's evolution over the years, offering valuable perspectives for enthusiasts and analysts alike.
