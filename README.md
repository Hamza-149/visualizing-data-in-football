# visualizing-data-in-football

We obtain a dataset from Kaggle that contains data of all the international football matches played between 1872 to 2022. We will be using Python throughout our analysis. First we start of by preparing the data and cleansing it of any anomalies in order to help us achieve an accurate output. Next we identify/analyse trends in the data which is then finally visualized.
